todos:
 - make avx and sse turn-off-able, threads count configurable even with cmdline flag
 - timestamp for logs
 - log to file not ui
 - create an output buffer. dont write directly to output for two reasons:
    - avx f()s write outside of it
    - input callback can do half of the processing then output cb the other half - jobsperchannel to be always even
 - dont consider first 10 callbacks. if priming dont aftermath; static inport_countdown, outport_countdown
 - consider last 3 sec for min/max
 - waitforsingleobject, timerobject to min time 100ns (5-6 samples) to sleep thread for min os cpu witth more (double) threads count
 - click/pops on correction
 - state save/load; delay; reload filters
